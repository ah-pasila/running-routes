# Running Routes Helsinki App

## Introduction

This web application contains info about nice running routes in Helsinki.

A normal user can create an account to the application and after doing this, add route suggestions for others to see and try.

Route suggestions can be saved as images to the service (Google Maps? or maybe GPX files - or both?).

Basic info such as length and difficulty can also be saved.

Routes can be rated.

Users can complete routes and save their times. After doing this, they are able to compare their times.

Admins are able to delete users, routes and reviews. Normal users can only delete their own reviews and route suggestions.

## Note on 20th November 2022:

I was not able to create db in Fly.io and the app can not unfortunately be tested. However, the files are available in Github. So far I have created a simple login window (without password check), mvp form to save info on routes and a route browser.

## Note on 4th December 2022:

The latest working version for the evualation: https://tsoha-running-routes.fly.dev/. It is possible to create user account, sign in, add routes and see the added routes. Also, the structure of the app has been improved. The next not-yet-functioning-version containing the possibilities to add .jpg map and route reviews is under development. In addition to this, layout.html has been created and implemented. The latest codes have been pushed to Github. There is still a lot to do!
