Running Routes Helsinki

This web application contains information about nice running routes in Helsinki.

A normal user can create an account to the application and after doing this, add route suggestions for others to see and try.

Route suggestions can be saved as images to the service (Google Maps? or maybe GPX files - or both?). Basic info such as length and difficulty can also be saved.

Routes can be rated.

Users can complete routes and save their times. After doing this, they are able to compare their times.

Admins are able to delete users, routes and reviews. Normal users can only delete their own reviews and accounts and route suggestions.

P.S. I haven't yet had time to set up the enviroment, so I made this file directly to Github.
Tried to set remote Github 08-11-2022 and removed README during process... still setting up the environment.
