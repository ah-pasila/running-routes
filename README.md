# Running Routes Helsinki App

## Introduction

This web application contains info about nice running routes in Helsinki.

A normal user can create an account to the application and after doing this, add route suggestions for others to see and try.

Route suggestions can be saved as images to the service (Google Maps? or maybe GPX files - or both?).

Basic info such as length and difficulty can also be saved.

Routes can be rated.

Users can complete routes and save their times. After doing this, they are able to compare their times.

Admins are able to delete users, routes and reviews. Normal users can only delete their own reviews and route suggestions.

## Note on 20th November 2022:

I was not able to create db in Fly.io and the app can not unfortunately be tested. However, the files are available in Github. So far I have created a simple login window (without password check), mvp form to save info on routes and a route browser.
